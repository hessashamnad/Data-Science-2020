## Installation
Here I have used the libraries from Anaconda Distribution of Python and Jypyter Notebook to write down the code.

## Project Motivation
I found the Google Job Skills data set from Kaggle and I got very excited to work on it.Being an aspiring Data Scientist, whose dream is to work at google, I was curious to understand what is demanded most in the career site to work at google.

## File Descriptions
I have saved the notebook with my analysis in this repository based on the following questions:
<li>What is the most demanded Programming Language ?
<li>How many years of Work Experience do you need  at google?
<li>What is the most popular degree mentioned under Minimum Qualifications?

## Result
The final results can be found in the post on medium.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Credit to Kaggle for providing the data set
